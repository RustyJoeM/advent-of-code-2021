# advent-of-code-2021

This small repo shows my solutions to problems given by Advent of Code challenge running on December 2021 - https://adventofcode.com/.

Implementation is done in Rust - https://www.rust-lang.org/.

Every day solution is computed in standalone small binary specific to each day...

Please note that Rust source code may not be up to production standards ;)
It uses lots of `unwrap()` calls, has several risks of panics on failure on invalid input, etc.
Goal was not to provide perfect code, but to achieve solution in reasonable time frame.
